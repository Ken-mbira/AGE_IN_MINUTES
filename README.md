## Future Improvements
As for improvement:
1. I'm thinking about adding options for getting the time in other time formats i.e seconds,hours,days,weeks etc.
2. Also I think we could add an option to calculate the time for famous events in history instead of just random selected dates
3. Plus a better looking UI :rofl:
